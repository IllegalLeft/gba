This repo just holds a bunch of my GBA demo programs. I just be doin' some
GBAz. Toncin' away.

### first
Just a cool demo that copies the key register and paints it across the whole
screen for psychadelic colours.

### map
Simple tile map demo. Tiles pulled from Super Mario Bros. 2 for GBA.

### rpgmap
Combination of a simple map and an object in the center of the screen. Similar
to your typical RPG. Sprites ripped from Dragon Warrior for SNES. L/R to switch
characters. D-Pad to move.
